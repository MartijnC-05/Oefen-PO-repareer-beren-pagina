		<p> My name is Martijn, I am 15 years old and I fix this bear page. </p>
		
		<H2> Why am I making a page about bears? </H2>
		<p> Bears look really cute, but they certainly aren't always!
			I am making this page because I think bears are very interesting animals and there are many different types of bears.
			I hope the reader learns something interesting about bears. </p>
